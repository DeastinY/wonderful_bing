#**Wonderful_Bing**
-----------------

#### My first python programme :)

### **How to use**
1.  Edit the `picture_path` in line 20, choose a folder that you want to 
    save the picture in, end with a '/'.
2.  Add it to autostart, then every time you boot up your pc, this script will 
    automatically download the picture from Bing and set it as the wallpaper ;)

### **Note**
*  Only works under linux, maybe there will be a windows version someday or you 
   can edit it by youself. It works fine on my linuxmint16.
